<p>Get the change for the S&P 500 for each day.</p>

<p>Write a loop that goes through the array, calculates a sum of the change, and pushes it to a new array along with the date.</p>

<p>Can just print in the console the array.</p>
    
<script>

// Put your javascript code in here

let snp_data = [{"Date":"2/16/24","Close":5005.57},{"Date":"2/15/24","Close":5029.73},{"Date":"2/14/24","Close":5000.62},{"Date":"2/13/24","Close":4953.17},{"Date":"2/12/24","Close":5021.84},{"Date":"2/9/24","Close":5026.61},{"Date":"2/8/24","Close":4997.91},{"Date":"2/7/24","Close":4995.06},{"Date":"2/6/24","Close":4954.23},{"Date":"2/5/24","Close":4942.81}];

/* For loop

Go through the length of the array,

minus one because you're not getting the change for the first day

*/

    
    // Calculcate the change by day

    // i is the current day, i+ 1 is the day before


    // Create an object

        // this gets the date value for the element from the snp_data

        // value of the change data you just calculated

    // push the change to the array



console.log(day_change); // prints the value out
